Porticode Project 10/12/16

Hey team, 

We have decided that we will use CapitalOne's API to make a webpage which helps the user manage his bank accounts, budget and let his friends know how broke he is to go out for the weekend! But we want the app/webpage to do something else as well. We want the friends of the user be allowed to let the user know whether they can pay for his taxi, meal etc. to try and convince him/her to come out especially is he/she is broke. This is useful because you may have a friend who you really want to chill with but they cant come out because theyre broke. But if you can somehow help them financially, then they might be able to come out for the weekend!
